# a-space-melody

So I started using this software called "Sonic Pi" by Sam Aaron
which produces music from writing programs!
This was what I looking for, but didn't know such thing existed
and only recently I came to know about it and it mixes up the 2
things I love, music and programming.

You are free to learn from, use or reproduce the code :)

Instructions:
There are 2 files.
"final space melody outro.rb" is played after "final space melody.rb" completes once.
The output you can watch is here:

Thank You.
